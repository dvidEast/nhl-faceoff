# nhl-faceoff

NHL Faceoff is a passion project and personal tool tailored to my love for hockey. As a fan of the game (go Canucks... :( ), I love to quantify/anaylze different statistics between players. However, over the past three years of consistently following the game, I could never find a web app that would easily let me faceoff, head to head, two different players without having to switch between different tabs and sites. 

NHL Faceoff is a simple solution for any hockey superfan. A hub to easily track all stats, points, and analytics between players of any position or team in the NHL.
